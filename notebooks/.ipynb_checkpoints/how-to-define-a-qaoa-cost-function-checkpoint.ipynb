    "Fire Opal's [QAOA Solver](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/fire-opal/topics/fire-opals-qaoa-solver)'s flexible input definition offers flexibility to enable you to solve any type of QAOA problem.\n",
    "One possible input is a `NetworkX Graph` object, which is automatically converted by Fire Opal to a cost function and mapped to qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the solver accepts a user-defined cost function as input, which makes it possible to define and solve both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. This guide only covers the use of a cost function as an input. For an example on using an input graph with the QAOA Solver, check out the tutorial on [Solving MaxCut using Fire Opal](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/fire-opal/apply/solve-max-cut-using-fire-opal).\n",

    "This guide provides examples of a few types of optimization problems that can be solved using the QAOA Solver and demonstrates how to construct the cost function as an input. The following problem types are covered:\n",
    "1. An unconstrained graph problem: MaxCut.\n",
    "1. A constrained problem, using penalty terms to formulate the constraints: Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC).\n",
    "1. A generalized unconstrained problem formulation: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO).\n",

    "The problems explained in ths guide are just a few examples; the QAOA Solver can be used to solve all sorts of optimization problems. For more information on building cost functions for optimization problems, [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005/full) provides detailed explanation."

The value of a given cut is the sum of weights of all edges that connect two nodes that belongs to different subsets. The [MaxCut problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) is defined as follows: given some undirected graph $G$, find the cut with the maximal value.\n",

Otherwise $(n_i + n_j − 2n_i n_j)$ is equal to zero and the edge is not in the cut.\n",
